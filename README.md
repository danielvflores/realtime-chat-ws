# realtime-chat-ws 🚀


## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **simple prototype** of a real-time chat system built using **WebSocket**, **TypeScript**, **SQL**, **Astro**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

I created this project for **educational purposes only**, and I used **GitHub Copilot** as a tool to assist me in the learning process.  
This is **not a production-ready application**.

I'm currently exploring and practicing new technologies, so **feedback is always welcome**! 👨‍💻
